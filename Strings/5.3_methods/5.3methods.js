"use strict";

// a string has a lot of different methods.

//a method is like a function, that belongs to an object
//(here a string is kind of an object), and does some kind of work on that object.

//example .trim()
const str1 = " there is    space here \n ";
const str2 = str1.trim();

console.log(str1);
console.log(str2);
