//You are going to test a lot of different array methods
//Start with this array:
const people = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"];

//And an empty variable to store a result:
let result;
//For each of the following methods, store the return value in the result,
//and note how the complete array looks, and what is returned. Like this:
result = people.push("Draco");

//result = people.pop();
//result = people.push("Neville");
//result = people.push("Luna");
//result = people.slice(0, 3);
//result = people.splice(1, 0, "Cho");
//people[1] = "Ginny";
//result = people.push("Fred", "George");
//result = people.indexOf("Fred");
//result = people.splice(result, 1);

console.log(result);
console.log(people);
